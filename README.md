## How to propose a rule change
This is primarily aimed at members of the Technical Committee (TC), but everyone
else can also propose changes to the rules.

1. Clone the repository and write and commit your changes.
1. When you have finished your proposal, push it somewhere.
   If you are a TC member, you can directly push your branch to this repository.
   Otherwise, you will need to create a fork.
1. Create a Pull Request.
1. Make sure that all tests pass and a proper rulebook is built from your PR.
1. Follow the discussion of your proposal and update your proposal by pushing
   changes to your branch, if necessary.
1. Once the pull request has been merged, the proposal is accepted and part of
   the rules for the next competition.

### Asking the TC to draft a change
If you have a proposal idea but you don't want to file a change proposal, then
please create an
[issue](https://github.com/robocup-logistics/rcll-rulebook/issues) and describe
your idea in detail.
This can also be used to ask for simple clarifications and other smaller fixes.
